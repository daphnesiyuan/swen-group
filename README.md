==========
1) Provide a short description on how to run the game.  That is, where the main method(s) are, how to start 
the server / client, what files are required, etc.

The game looks best in full screen

When you start the game it will launch into the start menu screen containing a few buttons to begin playing the game.
The start button will automatically set up your own server to play in and will require you to fill in a text field
with a username of your choice. Hitting the enter key after putting the input or pressing the connect button will
launch the game.

The join button is similar to the start button except the form will include an additional text field to input an IP address
for the server you desire to join. If any of the fields are empty or invalid, you will get an error message pop up and 
will have to input again with valid information.

The load button will open up a file chooser in which you can open a past saved file and resume game play from that point.

The help button will open a help page including information about game play and what various keys will do. You can hit the esc
key to open or close the help menu at any point during the game



2) Provide a short description on how to play the game.  In most cases, it should be easy to see from the game itself.  
But, in cases where it's hard to understand what we have to do, it really helps to have a guide...

When in game there is one main objective: get as many kills as possible. You can attack other players and AI bots, which will
give you points towards a point/kill system. You can also retreat to your own spawn room and connect to the battery
to refresh. These doors are locked by a colour-coded key which will activate if it is in your inventory.
You can pick up items to add to your inventory by walking over them and these are interactive. For example, if you have
a box you can click it and hit "open". You can also click on an item in the inventory and hit drop.

There is a map on the screen which will show your relative location to the room and enemies. Your avatar will show
a bobbling arrow to identify you from other robots.
Hit the alt key at any point to access chat and use features. The special key words are:
/disconnect: Will disconnect you from the server. 
/reconnect: Will reconnect you to the previously successfully connected server. 
/ip: Will print out your IP address. 
/ping: Will print out the current ping. 
and more.

Some commands are restricted to admins only such as:
/addbot: Generates a random bot to the server. 
/kick 'name': Kicks the named player from the server. 
and more

To view all the available commands with the chat feature, using /help will give you a list of all the commands possible in the chat box.

Use the keys WASD to move around the map, W-up, A-left, S-down, D-right.
Using the o-key will toggle charge mode used for attacking robots and refreshing the battery. However this is a little bit buggy
so attacking and plugging into a wall works better when you walk up to the object (avatar or charging block), and spam the o-key.
Using the cntrl key changes the angle viewing direction of the map.

At any point during game play the top menu has two options to either quit, or save your game. Quitting will revert you back
to the initial start screen.

To exit the game completely just hit the top right cross at the window and this will pop up with a warning messsage, are you sure
you want to quit? hit yes and you're done
